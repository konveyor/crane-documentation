This tutorial demonstrates how to mirror a simple stateless
[PHP Guestbook application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/)
using Crane.

# Roadmap

* Deploy Guestbook application in "source" cluster.
* Extract resources from "source" cluster using Crane Export.
* Generate transformations to prepare manifests for "destination" cluster using Crane
    Transform.
* Apply transformations using Crane Apply.
* Apply application manifests into "destination" cluster.

# Before You Begin

You will need a "source" and "destination" Kubernetes cluster. You can create an
environment in minikube with:

```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/crane/main/hack/minikube-clusters-start.sh")
```

or kind with:

```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/crane-runner/main/hack/kind-up.sh")
```

You will also need to install `crane`. See the [Installation Guide]({{<ref "/content/Getting Started/installation" >}}).

**NOTE**

Before proceeding, it may be helpful to read through
[Kubernetes' documentation on accessing multiple clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/).
The remainder of this document references a `src` and `dest` context that refer
to clusters you would have instantiated using our minikube startup scripts. If
you bring your own environment, or use kind (`kind-src` and `kind-dest`), you
will need modify the commands below to reference the correct cluster context.

# Deploy Guestbook Application in "source" Cluster

You will be deploying
[Kubernetes' stateless guestbook application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/)
modified here to be consumable via kustomize.
The guestbook application consisists of:

* redis leader deployment and service
* redis follower deployment and service
* guestbook front-end deployment and service


```bash
kubectl --context src create namespace guestbook
kustomize build github.com/konveyor/crane-runner/examples/resources/guestbook | kubectl --context src --namespace guestbook apply -f -
kubectl --context src --namespace guestbook wait --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app=guestbook --timeout=180s
```

**Optional**

Forward localhost traffic to the frontend of the guestbook application:

```bash
kubectl --context src --namespace guestbook port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80
```

Now you should be able to access the guestbook from the browser of your choice
via `localhost:8080`.


# Extract Resources From "source" Cluster

Crane's `export` command is how you extract all of the resources you want from
the "source" cluster.

```bash
crane export --context src --namespace guestbook
```

Make sure everything is working as expected by checking the `export` directory,
it should look something like:

```bash
$ tree -a export
export
├── failures
│   └── guestbook
└── resources
    └── guestbook
        ├── ConfigMap_guestbook_kube-root-ca.crt.yaml
        ├── Deployment_guestbook_frontend.yaml
        ├── Deployment_guestbook_redis-master.yaml

        ├── Service_guestbook_redis-master.yaml
        └── Service_guestbook_redis-slave.yaml

```

**NOTE**

What's happening here? `crane export` is using a discovery client to see all of
the API resources in the specified namespace of the designated cluster and
outputing them to disk in YAML form. This allows you to migrate your workloads
in a non-destructive way. Going forward you'll be working against these
manifests on disk without impacting the active resources in the "source"
cluster.

# Generate Transformations

Crane's `transform` command generates tranformations in the form of JSON patches
and stores those patches on disk in `transform` directory (unless overridden via
`--transform-dir`).

```bash
crane transform
```

And verify that it behaved as we expect by checking out the `transform`
directory:

```bash
$ tree -a transform
transform
└── resources
    └── guestbook
        ├── transform-ConfigMap_guestbook_kube-root-ca.crt.yaml
        ├── transform-Deployment_guestbook_frontend.yaml
        ├── transform-Deployment_guestbook_redis-master.yaml
        ├── transform-Deployment_guestbook_redis-slave.yaml
        ├── transform-Secret_guestbook_default-token-5vsrb.yaml
        ├── transform-ServiceAccount_guestbook_default.yaml
        ├── transform-Service_guestbook_frontend.yaml

        ├── .wh.Pod_guestbook_redis-slave-5c6b4c5b47-jnrsr.yaml
        ├── .wh.Pod_guestbook_redis-slave-5c6b4c5b47-xz776.yaml
        ├── .wh.ReplicaSet_guestbook_frontend-5fd859dcf6.yaml

2 directories, 24 files
```

**NOTE**

What `crane transform` is doing, is iterating through the configured plugins and
running them against the exported resources from the prevoius step. You can see
which plugins are configured with `crane transform list-plugins` **and** you can
see optional arguments to those plugins with `crane transform optionals`.

Now is a great time to explore what plugins you can configure with `crane
plugin-manager list`, install one, and maybe customize the exported resources
with something like:

```bash
crane transform --optional-flags="add-annotations=custom-crane-annotation=foo"
```

If the flags start to get tough to manage via the command-line, you can also
specify a `--flags-file` that might look something like:

```yaml
debug: false
export-dir: myExport
transform-dir: myTransform
output-dir: myOutput
optional-flags:
  add-annotations:
    custom-crane-annotation: "foo"
```

# Apply Transformations

Crane's `apply` command takes the exported resources + transformations saved as
JSON patches and renders the results as YAML files that you _should_ be able to
apply to another cluster as is.

```bash
crane apply
```

**NOTE**

To better understand what `crane` is doing during this step, go back and look at
one of the transformations created in the last step:

```bash
$ cat transform/resources/guestbook/transform-Deployment_guestbook_frontend.yaml
[{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/uid"},{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/resourceVersion"},{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/creationTimestamp"},{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/generation"},{"op":"remove","path":"/status"}]% 
```

So when crane "apply"s the transformations for the guestbook frontend, it will
be executing a handful of JSON patches that:

1. Remove the UID
1. Remove the resourceVersion
1. Remove the creationTimestamp
1. Remove the generation field
1. Remove the status

All of this data are leftovers from the "source" cluster and we are removing
them from the final manifests to make them applicable to the "destination"
cluster. At this stage, these resources are effectively cluster agnostic ready
to be `kubectl apply`ed to the cluster of your choosing **OR** placed under
version control to be later managed by GitOps + CI/CD Pipelines.  If you were
to specify optional flags, you would likely see additional patches that may
add/remove/replace additional fields on the resources previously exported.

# Apply Manifests to "destination" Cluster

Now that you have manifests prepared for the "destination" cluster, you can
apply them using `kubectl` directly:

```bash
kubectl --context dest create namespace guestbook
kubectl --context dest --namespace guestbook --recursive=true apply -f ./output
```

**NOTE**

If you wanted to change the namespace, you could use something like Kustomize:

```bash
cd apply/resources/guestbook
kustomize init --namespace custom-guestbook --autodetect
```

You would end up with a `kustomization.yaml` that looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ConfigMap_guestbook_kube-root-ca.crt.yaml
- Deployment_guestbook_frontend.yaml
- Deployment_guestbook_redis-master.yaml
- Deployment_guestbook_redis-slave.yaml
- Secret_guestbook_default-token-5vsrb.yaml
- ServiceAccount_guestbook_default.yaml
- Service_guestbook_frontend.yaml
- Service_guestbook_redis-master.yaml
- Service_guestbook_redis-slave.yaml
namespace: custom-guestbook
```

And you could apply it (after creating the `custom-guestbook` namespace of
course) with `kubectl apply -k .`
